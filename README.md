# Fi-NeMo: Finding Neural Network Motifs

**Fi-NeMo** (**Fi**nding **Ne**ural Network **Mo**tifs) is a GPU-accelerated motif instance calling tool for identifying transcription factor binding sites from neural network contribution scores.

## Overview

Fi-NeMo implements a competitive optimization approach using proximal gradient descent to identify motif instances by solving a sparse linear reconstruction problem. Unlike traditional sequence-based methods, Fi-NeMo leverages context-aware importance scores from deep neural networks to comprehensively map transcription factor binding sites, enabling the identification of both high-confidence canonical motifs and low-prevalence cofactor motifs that are often missed by conventional approaches.

The algorithm represents contribution scores as weighted combinations of motif contribution weight matrices (CWMs) at specific genomic positions. This competitive assignment process more closely reflects the biological reality of transcription factors competing for binding sites, resulting in superior sensitivity and specificity compared to sequence-only methods.

### Features

- **GPU-accelerated optimization**: Fast processing of large contribution score datasets using PyTorch
- **Competitive motif assignment**: Biologically-motivated algorithm that resolves similar motifs
- **Context-aware analysis**: Leverages neural network importance scores for improved sensitivity and specificity
- **Comprehensive evaluation**: Built-in tools for assessing and visualizing motif discovery quality and hit calling performance
- **Multiple input formats**: Support for bigWig, HDF5, and TF-MoDISco output formats

## Method

Fi-NeMo solves motif instance calling as an optimization problem that reconstructs contribution score tracks as sparse linear combinations of motif CWMs, formulated as an L1-regularized linear model. This competitive assignment encourages overlapping motif instances to be resolved in a meaningful way, with stronger matches receiving higher coefficients while weaker or redundant matches are suppressed.

## Command-Line Usage

Fi-NeMo provides a command-line utility named `finemo` for motif instance calling and analysis. The typical workflow involves three main steps:

1. **Preprocessing**: Transform input contributions and sequences into a unified format
2. **Hit Calling**: Identify motif instances using the Fi-NeMo algorithm  
3. **Reporting and Analysis**: Generate visualizations and perform post-processing

For detailed options for any subcommand, run `finemo <subcommand> -h`.

### Preprocessing

The following commands transform input contributions and sequences into a compressed `.npz` file for quick loading. This file contains:

- `sequences`: A one-hot-encoded sequence array (`np.int8`) with dimensions `(n, 4, w)`, where `n` is the number of regions, and `w` is the width of each region. Bases are ordered as ACGT.
- `contributions`: A contribution score array (`np.float16`) with dimensions `(n, 4, w)` for hypothetical scores or `(n, w)` for projected scores only.

If peak region coordinates are provided, the output also includes:

- `chr`: An array of chromosome names (`np.dtype('U')`) with dimensions `(n)`.
- `chr_id`: An array of numerical chromosome IDs (`np.uint32`) with dimensions `(n)`.
- `peak_region_start`: An array of peak region start coordinates (`np.int32`) with dimensions `(n)`.
- `peak_id`: An array of numerical peak region IDs (`np.uint32`) with dimensions `(n)`.
- `peak_name`: An array of peak region names (`np.dtype('U')`) with dimensions `(n)`.

Preprocessing commands do not require GPU.

#### Shared arguments

- `-o/--out-path`: The path to the output `.npz` file. Required.
- `-w/--region-width`: The width of the input region centered around each peak summit. Default is 1000.

- `-s/--sequences`: A `.npy` or `.npz` file containing one-hot encoded sequences.
- `-a/--attributions`: One or more `.npy` or `.npz` files of hypothetical contribution scores, with paths delimited by whitespace. Scores are averaged across files.

### Hit Calling

#### `finemo call-hits`

Identify motif instances in input regions using the Fi-NeMo competitive optimization algorithm. This is the core functionality that leverages TF-MoDISco CWMs to find motif occurrences in contribution score data.

`params.json`: The parameters used for hit calling.

#### Parameter Guidelines

**Sensitivity Control (`-l/--global-lambda`)**
- Controls sparsity and sensitivity of hit calling
- Higher values (e.g., 0.8-0.9) → fewer, higher-confidence hits
- Lower values (e.g., 0.5-0.6) → more sensitive, may include weaker hits
- Default of 0.7 works well for chromatin accessibility data
- ChIP-seq data may benefit from lower values (0.6)

**Motif Trimming (`-t/--cwm-trim-threshold`)**  
- Determines where motif boundaries are set within full CWMs
- Lower values → more conservative trimming, longer motifs
- Higher values → more aggressive trimming, shorter core motifs
- Affects resolution of closely-spaced motif instances

**Performance Optimization (`-b/--batch-size`, `-J`)**
- Set batch size to utilize available GPU memory efficiently
- Reduce batch size if you encounter out-of-memory errors
- Enable JIT compilation (`-J`) for faster execution on newer GPUs

#### Important Notes

- **Scale Invariance**: Hit calling depends on motif and contribution score shapes, not absolute magnitudes. Use `hit_coefficient_global` or `hit_importance` for importance-based thresholding.
- **Legacy Format Support**: Convert older TF-MoDISco files using `modisco convert` from [tfmodisco-lite](https://github.com/jmschrei/tfmodisco-lite).

### Output reporting and post-processing

#### `finemo report`

Generate an HTML report (`report.html`) visualizing TF-MoDISco seqlet recall and hit distributions.
If `-n/--no-recall` is not set, the regions used for hit calling must exactly match those used during the TF-MoDISco motif discovery process.
This command does not utilize the GPU.

Usage: `finemo report -r <regions> -H <hits> -o <out_dir> [-m <modisco_h5>] [-W <modisco_region_width>] [-n]`

- `-r/--regions`: A `.npz` file containing input sequences, contributions, and coordinates. Must be the same as that used for `finemo call-hits`.
- `-H/--hits`: The output directory generated by the `finemo call-hits` command on the regions specified in `--regions`.
- `-o/--out-dir`: The path to the report output directory.
- `-m/--modisco-h5`: The tfmodisco-lite output H5 file of motif patterns. Must be the same as that used for hit calling unless `--no-recall` is set. If omitted, seqlet-derived metrics will not be computed.
- `-W/--modisco-region-width`: The width of the region around each peak summit used by tfmodisco-lite. Default is 400.
- `-n/--no-recall`: Do not compute motif recall metrics. Default is False.

Additional report outputs:

- `motif_report.tsv`: Statistics on the distribution of hits per motif. The columns and values correspond to those in the HTML report's table.
- `motif_occurrences.tsv`: The number of hits of each motif in each input region. Also includes the total number of hits per region.
- `CWMs`: A directory containing visualizations of motif CWMs, as well as corresponding tables with numerical CWM values.
- `seqlets.tsv`: tf-modisco seqlet coordinates for each motif in each region. Only generated if `-m/--modisco-h5` is provided.

#### `finemo collapse-hits`

Identify the best hits by motif similarity within groups of overlapping hits. Adds a 0/1 `is_primary` column to the `hits.tsv` file, indicating whether a hit is the best hit in its group. This command does not utilize the GPU.

Usage: `usage: finemo collapse-hits -i <hits> -o <out_path> [-O <overlap>]`

- `-i/--hits`: The path to the input hits file. This should be the `hits.tsv` or `hits_unique.tsv` file generated by the `finemo call-hits` command.
- `-o/--out-path`: The path to the output file. This will be a copy of the input file with an additional `is_primary` column.
- `-O/--overlap-frac`: The minimum fraction overlap required for two hits to be considered overlapping. Precisely, given two hits of lengths `x` and `y`, the minimum number of overlapping bases is `overlap_frac * (x + y) / 2`. Default is 0.2.

#### `finemo intersect-hits`

Find the intersection of hits across multiple runs. This command does not utilize the GPU.

Usage: `finemo intersect-hits -i <hits> -o <out_path> [-r]`

- `-i/--hits`: The path to one or more input hits file. This should be the `hits.tsv` or `hits_unique.tsv` file generated by the `finemo call-hits` command.
- `-o/--out-path`: The path to the output file. Reoccuring columns are suffixed with the positional index of the input file (e.g. `hit_importance_1`), with the exception of index 0.
- `-r/--relaxed`: By default, the intersection assumes consistent input region definitions (name and coordinates) and motif trimming across runs. In contrast, this relaxed intersection criteria uses only motif names and untrimmed hit coordinates. However, this is not suitable when hit genomic coordinates are unknown (e.g. when using `finemo call-hits` with `-p/--peaks`). Default is False.
